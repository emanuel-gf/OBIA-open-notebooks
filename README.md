# OBIA-open-notebooks
This repository is a assembly of Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) methods. The notebook aims to apply the state-of-art of image analysis in an object-based instead of pixel-based. Most of the material is based on the lectures of the OBIA class from Z-GIS departament, Paris-Lodron Univerity of Salzburg. 
A big thanks to all my incredible teachers: Dirk Tiede; Stephen Lang; Tomas Blanschke.

A significant part of the content is available on the internet, but since the information is very sparse, I am adding further reading at the end of the notebook, containing valuable information and knowledge from OBIA methods.
